## Description
## Quick Setup

### Setting up Kube Prometheus Stack
Using Kube prometheus stack helm charts to setup basic prometheus:
https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack

```shell
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

helm install kube-prometheus-stack prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack
```

Expose Prometheus endpoint via Port forwarding
```shell
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-operated 9090:9090
```

Access Prometheus dashboard via https://localhost:9090

### Setting up operator
This setup assumes you have a Kubernetes cluster set up with correct permissions and network that can reach public internet.

1. Depending on your kubernetes CLI command, change in Makefile line 187 to `KUBECTL ?= {kubectl command}`.
Eg. For Microk8s you may change it to `KUBECTL ?= microk8s kubectl`. For Minikube use `KUBECTL ?= minikube kubectl --`

2. Run and ensure the operator deployment is running on the kubernetes cluster.
```shell
make deploy

# wait for operator pods to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=available deployment/invoker-operator-controller-manager
```

You can now apply custom InvokerDeployments onto the cluster.

## Setting up Dependencies to run Word Count

### Setting up Kafka

First you need to set up a Kafka Cluster reachable by Kubernetes plane. This can be in localhost.

1. Get Kafka. Step 1 of [Quickstart Guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart).
2. Start Zookeeper
```shell
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
```
3. Change `config/server.properties` field `advertised.listeners` to your network public ip
```el
advertised.listeners=PLAINTEXT://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP:9092
```
4. Start Kafka Broker
```shell
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```
5. Create input and output topic: These must match the input and output topics configured in the InvokerDeployment YAML.
```shell
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic test --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 6
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic count --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic output --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

6. Create cli producer for input topic or use a Kafka application.
```shell
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic test --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
# add flags --property "parse.key=true" --property "key.separator=:" to send key with key:value
```

7. Create consumer for output topic
```shell
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092  --topic output  --formatter kafka.tools.DefaultMessageFormatter --property print.key=true  --property print.value=true
```

### Finding the localhost ip for Kafka broker
To connect the kubernetes pod to Kafka, the `kafka.broker` address in the config.yaml must be setup correctly.
This section details what you need to do if your Kafka broker is running on `localhost:9092`.
If Kafka is already setup in another IP reachable from the K8S cluster, replacing `kafka.broker` value will be enough.

Kind exposes localhost of your machine same way as docker: using `host.docker.internal`.

In Minikube and Microk8s the process is more complicated.
#### On MacOS
Use ifconfig to find the localhost ip for your host machine.
```shell
ifconfig
```
Under `en0`, the ipv4 address next to the `inet` row should be usable.

. After the operator pods are running. Apply the custom resource yamls. The example is located in `config/samples`. 
```
kubectl apply -f config/samples/invokeroperator_v1alpha1_invokerdeployment.yaml
``` 

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on Kind
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/invoker-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/invoker-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
